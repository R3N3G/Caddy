# Gogs

This is an example configuration on how to use [Gogs](https://gogs.io) with Caddy.

The configuration takes following assumptions:

1. You install Gogs under user `git` with home directory `/home/git`.
2. The Gogs installation path is `/home/git/gogs`.
3. Gogs listens on port `3000`.
4. You use domain name `mygogs.com`.

Please be sure to change with your actual values.
