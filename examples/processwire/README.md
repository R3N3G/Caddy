# Processwire
ProcessWire is a free PHP content management system and framework (open source CMS/CMF) built to save you time and work the way you do. Stop trying to bend other open source CMS platforms to your will â€“ ProcessWire provides simpler and stronger control over your pages, fields, templates and markup at any scale.

This is an example configuration on how to use [Processwire](https://processwire.com) with Caddy. This document is based on the Wordpress guide since both systems share similar requirements.

## Help

If you need help with Caddy and Processwire visit the forums
[Caddy and Processwire](https://processwire.com/talk/topic/11729-caddy-a-lightweight-http2-web-server/)

## Prerequisites

Processwire has the following [requirements](https://processwire.com/docs/tutorials/installation-moving-and-troubleshooting/page2)

- PHP version 5.3.8 or greater
- MySQL version 5.0.15 or greater

On Ubuntu Linux, we can install them using the following commands:

````
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install mysql-server php5-mysql php5-fpm
````

During the installation, MySQL will ask you to set a root password.

To finish the installation, we need to activate MySQL and secure the installation:

````
sudo mysql_install_db
sudo /usr/bin/mysql_secure_installation
````

## Create Processwire Database

With all the prerequisites in place, we can go ahead and create a new MySQL database and user for Processwire.

First, log into the MySQL Shell:

````
mysql -u root -p
````

Now, create the database and user:

````
CREATE DATABASE processwire;
CREATE USER pwuser@localhost;
SET PASSWORD FOR pwuser@localhost= PASSWORD("password");
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON processwire.* TO pwuser@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
exit
````

A couple of things are going on here:

1. Create the actual `processwire` database.
2. Create the user `pwuser`.
3. Set a password for this user.
4. Grant all privileges of the `processwire` database to this user.
5. Reload the new user settings.

Feel free to name you database or user differently.

## Download & install Processwire

We can get the latest version of Processwire from their official website:

````
curl  -SL http://grab.pw > pw.zip && unzip pw.zip && rm pw.zip 

````

Use the Caddyfile in this example and make sure that fastcgi is listening on port 9000

Now, we can finally run `caddy`. If everything went right, you'll be greeted by Processwire once you visit `http://localhost`. From here on, Processwire will guide you through the rest of the setup.

## Troubleshooting

The most common error you might encounter is `502 Bad Gateway`. In this case, proceed as following:

- Check `/var/log/php5-fpm.log` for any errors.
- Add `errors visible` to your `Caddyfile`
- Often times, php-fpm doesn't work because of wrong permissions. Check the error logs and change the user in `/etc/php5/fpm/pool.d/www.conf`
- Switching to a Unix socket might help. Change the listen directive in `/etc/php5/fpm/pool.d/www.conf` to `listen = unix:/var/run/php5-fpm.sock` and adjust your `Caddyfile` accordingly.
- If using a unix socket, make sure Caddy has access to the socket file.

Otherwise, search for guides on how to set up `fastcgi` for Nginx. The configuration for `fastcgi` is identical for Nginx and Caddy, but Nginx has a lot more tutorials online.
